    "hi": "I’m Evgeniy, but people call me “KelWin” I’m a frontend developer, and I specialize in efficient React apps and CSS & HTML that just work across all platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that are usable and pleasant for the most number of people possible.",
    "life": "My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for design and structure. I was sketching crazy detailed 3d models for fun when I was a kid, started building promo websites for small businesses while in school, then developed an app for my gaming guild in my university days. For three years, I’ve worked for an e-commerce platform in Berlin, where I was able to drive a 10% growth in sales by shaving five seconds from the website’s loading time. After that, I was in charge of implementing and launching the mobile app for a large European medical supply provider, which I was able to complete in just under three months. Not that learning React Native at the same time made things easy for me. Still, in the end, I was able to deliver an app that’s used by hundreds of distributors and direct customers daily and did so on-time and on-budget.",
    "right":"Right now, I’m excited about the still very complicated WebAssembly, and working towards becoming a React senior. In the following years, I also plan to explore the “server-side” more and become a better-rounded full-stack dev.",
